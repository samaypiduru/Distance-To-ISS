# Distance-To-ISS

A simple page that uses geolocation and the Open Notify API to calculate the distance between a user and the International Space Station in real-time.

For simplicity, the calculations make a few assumptions.<br>
(1) The Earth has a constant radius of 3963 miles.<br>
(2) The ISS is at a constant altitude of 254 miles above Earth's surface.<br>
(3) The user's altitude is approximately sea level.
