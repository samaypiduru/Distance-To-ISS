# Distance-To-ISS

A simple page that uses geolocation and the Open Notify API to calculate the distance between a user and the International Space Station in real-time.

For simplicity, the calculations make a few assumptions, such as 
(1) The Earth has a constant radius of 3963 miles.
(2) the ISS is at a constant altitude of 254 miles above Earth's surface.
